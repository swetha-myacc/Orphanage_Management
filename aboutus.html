<p> As Orphanages are increasing in day to basis simultaneously the helping hands are also increasing in higher range. The practical difficulty is finding out the real orphans and the less knowledge about the donation details.

It allows the users to search and find the orphanges on internet and then they can donate with the orphanages whichever they want.
By selecting the region, donor will get the details of the nearby government approved organizations. The main motive is to eliminate these   drawbacks and help orphans to full extend.
